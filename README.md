# About

`herding-cats` is a Scala library for working with [Apache Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/).  It uses the
[Scala delimited continuations plugin](http://lamp.epfl.ch/~rompf/continuations-icfp09.pdf) to eliminate structuring your code as a
series of callbacks (i.e.: inversion of control).  The result is a much cleaner way to work with Zookeeper.

## Status

Just started hacking on this recently.  Much to do, but starting to come together.  Sorry, no examples yet, but soon!
